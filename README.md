# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide webpage was created to assist not only myself, but other fellow coding bootcamp attendees to study the large amount of complex concepts introduced through the prework section of our coding bootcamp. This webpage not only compiles the various concepts into easy to read and digestible bullet points, it includes functionality to help guide your studying using random suggestions on which topic you should study first. This webpage aims to ease the anxiety that can come with the overwhelming nature of a coding bootcamp by compiling the vast amount of information learned through the prework section of the coding bootcamp in one central location.
